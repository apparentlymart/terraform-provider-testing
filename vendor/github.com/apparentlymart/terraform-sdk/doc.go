// Package tfsdk is the main package of a library that implements Terraform's
// plugin protocols and maps them on to a higher-level API intended to allow
// convenient implementation of Terraform provider plugins in Go.
//
// This module is currently in an early exploration phase and not intended to
// be used for production plugins. To develop plugins for Terraform today,
// see the Terraform Extend documentation at https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/ .
