# Terraform Testing Provider

This provider is an experiment in writing simple tests for your reusable
Terraform modules using Terraform itself.

It's currently very much a prototype and subject to change at any time as we
continue to explore the use-cases and possible approaches.

**This is not a HashiCorp project.**

For information on usage, see [the `docs` directory](./docs).
